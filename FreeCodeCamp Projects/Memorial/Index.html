    <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Ozi's life:</h2>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>1974 - Born in Soviet Russia</li>
        
        <li>1990 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Konya, thanks <br>
            to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
        
        <li>1995 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br>
             Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br>
              them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>

        <li>1997 - Finishes university and takes a job in the Turkish Forestry Service</li>
        
        <li>1998 - Marries wife of 30 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br>
             cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br>
              Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
        <li>1999 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Edirne attack,<br>
             but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,<br>
              DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
        <li>2000 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
        
        <li>2002 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife,<br>
             and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds<br>
              6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
    </ul>
