                <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was<br>
                     invented by Brendan Eich.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games,<br>
                    animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p> 
                    
                <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on<br>
                    top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.<br>
                    These include:</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="A_Hello_world!_example">
            <header class="title">A Hello world! example</header>
            <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your<br>
             websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
            <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with<br>
             HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To<br>
             begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the standard for<br>
             introductory programming examples.)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, create a<br>
                     new text document called <div class="box">main.js</div>, and save it.</li>
                <li>In your <div>index.html</div> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing <div class="box">&lt;/body&gt;</div> tag<br>
                    <code class="box">&lt;script src="scripts/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
                </li>
                <li>This is doing the same job as the &lt;link&gt; element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page,<br>
                     so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>
                <li>Add this code to the <div class="box">main.js</div> file:
                    <code class="box">const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
                        myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";</code>
                </li>
                <li>Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load <div class="box">index.html</div> in your browser. You<br>
                    should see something like this:</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="images/hello-world.png" alt="a image with Hello world text">

            <header class="title">Language basics crash course</header>
            <p>To give you a better understanding of how JavaScript works, let's explain some of the core features<br>
             of the language. It's worth noting that these features are common to all programming languages. If<br>
             you master these fundamentals, you have a head start on coding in other languages too!</p>
             <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword,<br>
             followed by the name you give to the variable:</p>
             <code class="box">let myVariable;</code>
             <p>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need<br>
             to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have<br>
            semicolons at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when you should and shouldn't use semicolons.<br>
             For more details, see Your Guide to Semicolons in JavaScript</p>
             <p>You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some restrictions. (See this section about<br>
                naming rules.) If you are unsure, you can check your variable name to see if it's valid.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have<br>
                    problems in your code, check the case!</p>
                <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</p>
                <code class="box">myVariable = "Bob";</code>
                <p>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:</p>
                <code class="box">let myVariable = "Bob";</code>
                <p>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:</p>
                <code class="box">myVariable;</code>
                <p>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:</p>
                <code class="box">let myVariable = "Bob";myVariable = "Steve";</code>

            <header class="title">Supercharging our example website</header>
            <p>With this review of JavaScript basics completed (above), let's add some new features to our example<br>
             site.</p>
            <p>Before going any further, delete the current contents of your main.js file — the bit you added earlier<br> 
            during the "Hello world!" example — and save the empty file. If you don't, the existing code will clash<br> 
            with the new code you are about to add.</p>
